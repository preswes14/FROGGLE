                           FROGGLE
                    Steam Deck Setup Guide
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Welcome! This guide will walk you through installing FROGGLE on
your Steam Deck. It takes about 5 minutes. Follow each step
carefully and you'll be playing in no time!


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                       DOWNLOAD LINK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                        t.ly/FROGGLE

      (Type this into any web browser to get the game)


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               STEP 1: ENTER DESKTOP MODE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your Steam Deck has two modes:
  • Gaming Mode - the normal view with your games
  • Desktop Mode - works like a regular computer

We need to use Desktop Mode to download and set up FROGGLE.

HERE'S HOW:

   1. Press and HOLD the POWER button
      (the small button on the top-right edge of your Deck)

   2. Keep holding for about 2 seconds until a menu appears

   3. A list of options will pop up on screen

   4. Tap "Switch to Desktop"

   5. Wait about 10 seconds for the desktop to load

You'll see a computer desktop with some icons. You're ready
for the next step!


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               STEP 2: DOWNLOAD FROGGLE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   1. Look for the Firefox icon and tap it
      (It's orange and purple, looks like a fox)

   2. Once Firefox opens, tap the address bar at the top
      (That's where website addresses go)

   3. A keyboard will appear. Type exactly:

                        t.ly/FROGGLE

   4. Press Enter on the keyboard

   5. A download page will appear

   6. Look for a file that ends in ".AppImage"
      (It's the big file in the list - tap it!)

   7. If a box pops up asking what to do, choose "Save File"

   8. Wait for the download to finish
      (You'll see a progress bar - it only takes a minute)


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               STEP 3: MAKE THE FILE RUNNABLE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The file you downloaded needs permission to run. This is a
safety feature - we just need to tell your Deck it's okay!

   1. Look for the Dolphin icon and tap it
      (It's a blue folder icon - this opens your files)

   2. On the left side of the window, tap "Downloads"

   3. Find the FROGGLE file you just downloaded
      (It ends with .AppImage)

   4. RIGHT-CLICK on the file

      *** HOW TO RIGHT-CLICK ON STEAM DECK: ***
      Tap and hold the file for 1 second, OR
      Tap with two fingers at the same time

   5. A menu will appear - tap "Properties" (near the bottom)

   6. A new window opens. Tap the "Permissions" tab at the top

   7. Look for a checkbox that says "Is executable"
      PUT A CHECK IN THAT BOX (tap it)

   8. Tap "OK" to close the window

Great! The file is now ready to run.


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               STEP 4: ADD FROGGLE TO STEAM
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Now we'll add FROGGLE to your Steam library so you can play
it from Gaming Mode like any other game.

   1. Look for the Steam icon on the desktop and tap it
      (It's the normal Steam logo you know)

   2. Steam will open. Look at the very top menu bar

   3. Tap "Games" in the menu bar

   4. Tap "Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library..."

   5. A window appears. Tap the "Browse..." button at the bottom

   6. On the left side, tap "Downloads"

   7. IMPORTANT: You might not see the file yet!

      Look at the bottom of the window - there's a dropdown
      that probably says "Applications"

      TAP IT AND CHANGE IT TO "All Files"

   8. Now you should see the FROGGLE .AppImage file
      Tap it to select it (it will highlight)

   9. Tap "Open"

  10. You'll be back at the first window
      Make sure FROGGLE has a checkmark next to it

  11. Tap "Add Selected Programs"

FROGGLE is now in your Steam library!


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               STEP 5: RETURN TO GAMING MODE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Time to go back to the normal Steam Deck view!

   1. Look on the desktop for an icon called:
      "Return to Gaming Mode"

   2. Double-tap it

   3. Wait a few seconds for Gaming Mode to load

You're back to normal! Now let's play!


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               PLAYING FROGGLE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   1. Open your Library (press the STEAM button, then Library)

   2. Scroll down to find FROGGLE
      (It might be in a "Non-Steam" section at the bottom)

      TIP: You can also search for "FROGGLE" using the
      search icon at the top!

   3. Select FROGGLE

   4. Press PLAY

   5. Enjoy!
