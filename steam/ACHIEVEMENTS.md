## Notes & TODO



### Achievement Design Principles:

- Mix of natural progression (Tier 1) and aspirational goals (Tier 4)
- Hero-specific achievements drive replayability
- Build-specific challenges encourage experimentation
- Collection achievements reward exploration
- Prestige achievements give hardcore players something to chase

### Steam Technical Notes:

- Default limit: 100 achievements (plenty of room to grow)
- No official "points" system on Steam
- Achievement names should be concise and evocative
- Descriptions can be more detailed (not shown here yet)
