## Notes & TODO

### Questions to Resolve:

1. How many heroes total? Need to create "Win with [Hero]" achievement for each
1. What exactly are "death boys"? Is this secret content?
1. How many statuettes exist? Any collection achievement?
1. What's the exact unlock path for Tapo? Any intermediate achievements?
1. Define damage/turn thresholds for challenge achievements
1. Are there different enemy types beyond dragons worth calling out?

### Achievement Design Principles:

- Mix of natural progression (Tier 1) and aspirational goals (Tier 4)
- Hero-specific achievements drive replayability
- Build-specific challenges encourage experimentation
- Collection achievements reward exploration
- Prestige achievements give hardcore players something to chase

### Steam Technical Notes:

- Default limit: 100 achievements (plenty of room to grow)
- No official "points" system on Steam
- Achievement names should be concise and evocative
- Descriptions can be more detailed (not shown here yet)
