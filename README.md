## Brainstorm & Polish Zone 🐸✨

_A space for tweaking copy, voice consistency, and making everything feel delightfully froggy._

### Current Voice Checklist
- [ ] Playful and punny (but not groan-worthy)
- [ ] Self-aware without being annoying
- [ ] Enthusiastic without being manic
- [ ] References land (Michigan J. Frog, Budweiser frogs, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent "frog pun density" across all text

### Things to Review/Consider

**README Inconsistencies:**
- Line 25 has a typo: "Inscrytpion" → "Inscryption"
- Line 25 formatting: underscore/italic combo `-_Inspired...` looks odd
- Version in "Repository Structure" says v9.97 but game is now v12.73+
- "For Beta Testers" section - is the game still in beta? Should this be "How to Play"?

**Voice Questions:**
- Death quotes mix Michigan J. Frog lyrics with original content - is that intentional? (Copyright-adjacent?)
- "please don't steal it please!" - charming or unprofessional? (I vote charming)
- Is "weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable" the tagline? It's great but buried mid-paragraph

**Feature List Polish:**
- Current: "9 encounters, each with a hidden unlockable second stage"
- Are there really 9 encounters? Double-check count
- "18 strategic combat floors" - there are 10 combat floors (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19)
- Consider: odd floors are combat, even are neutral - might be clearer

**Potential Taglines to Test:**
- "Save Tapo. Roll dice. Get frogged."
- "A roguelike that ribbits different"
- "Tactically questionable. Emotionally devastating. Extremely froggy."
- "Die. Upgrade. Ribbit. Repeat."

**Missing from README?**
- PWA/installable mention (it's a full app!)
- Controller/Steam Deck support deserves more than a one-liner
- No screenshots or GIFs - would help a lot
- No mention of the procedural music/sound system (it's cool!)

**Easter Eggs & Secrets - Document or Keep Hidden?**
- Ghost Boys encounter
- Ancient Statuette
- Tapo as 5th hero (mentioned but vague)
- FU mode portal
- Second-stage neutral encounters

### Draft Rewrites

**Current About (first line):**
> FROGGLE is a weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable (f)roguelike dungeon crawler

**Option A - Punchier:**
> FROGGLE is a tactical (f)roguelike where every run makes your frogs permanently stronger—even when you die. Especially when you die.

**Option B - More Mysterious:**
> FROGGLE is a turn-based dungeon crawler hiding secrets in every corner. A tadpole needs saving. The dice are loaded in your favor. The frogs are counting on you.

**Option C - Keep but Clean:**
> FROGGLE is a weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable roguelike dungeon crawler. (Yes, with frogs. No, we won't apologize.)
