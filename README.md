## About

FROGGLE is a weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable (f)roguelike dungeon crawler featuring:
- An adorable Tadpole named Tapo who you MUST SAVE!
- Tactically questionable. Emotionally devastating. Extremely froggy.
- 4 unique hero classes (can you unlock the secret 5th hero!?)
- Many mysterious encounters, each with a hidden unlockable second stage (find them all!)
- Rich, tactical turn-based combat from punk goblins to the terrifying FLYDRA
- 7 unique upgradable active abilities with powerful effects
- 3 passive abilities that the whole team benefits from upgrading
- Spend gold on death to buy PERMANENT upgrades for your party!
- The chance to swing ANY battle at ANY time with a lucky roll!
- A hidden game mode - FROGGED UP mode - (once you clear standard)
- Funky froggy procedurally-generated beats
- All kinds of secrets and easter eggs!

*Inspired by Slay the Spire, Balatro, and Inscryption - if you like any of these, you'll probably like FROGGLE!*
