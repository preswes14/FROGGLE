- 9 encounters, each with a hidden unlockable second stage (find them all!)
- 18 strategic combat floors, from punk goblins to the terrifying FLYDRA
- 7 unique upgradable active abilities with powerful effects
- 3 passive abilities that the whole team benefits from upgrading
- Spend gold on death to buy PERMANENT upgrades for your party!
- The chance to swing ANY battle at ANY time with a lucky roll!
- A hidden game mode - FROGGED UP mode - (once you clear standard)
- Rich, strategic turn-based combat
- All kinds of secrets and easter eggs!
-_Inspired by Slay the Spire, Balatro, and Inscrytpion - if you like any of these, you'll probably like FROGGLE!_
