## About

FROGGLE is a *weirdly empowering*, **delightfully breakable** (**f**)roguelike dungeon crawler featuring:
- An adorable little Tadpole named Tapo who YOU must save, or you will ruin his first birthday!
- 4 Brave Frogventurers (Warrior, Tank, Mage, and Healer) - _can you unlock the secret 5th hero??_
- Rich, tactical turn-based combat ranging from punk goblins to the fearsome final boss!  Basic initially; progressively awesomer.
- The chance to swing ANY battle at ANY time with a lucky roll!
- Msterious encounters, each with a hidden unlockable second stage (can you unlock them all?!)
- Spend XP mid-run to upgrade stats or add/enhance abilities
- Buy PERMANENT upgrades for your entire party from Death himself!
- 4 Basic starter sigils with intuitive actions (attack, shield, heal, and the lucky D20)
- 3 advanced upgradable active abilities with powerful effects (like preventing death or granting turns to an ally)
- 3 game-changing passive abilities that the heroes gain/upgrade as a team!
- A wildly challenging game mode - FROGGED UP mode - (clear Standard to unlock)
- Funky froggy procedurally-generated beats
- Lots of fun tidbits and easter eggs!

*Inspired by Slay the Spire, Balatro, and Inscryption - if you like any of these, you'll probably like FROGGLE!*
