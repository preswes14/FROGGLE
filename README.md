## Brainstorm & Polish Zone 🐸✨

_A space for tweaking copy, voice consistency, and making everything feel delightfully froggy._

### Current Voice Checklist
- [ ] Playful and punny (but not groan-worthy)
- [ ] Self-aware without being annoying
- [ ] Enthusiastic without being manic
- [ ] References land (Michigan J. Frog, Budweiser frogs, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent "frog pun density" across all text

### Things to Review/Consider

**README Inconsistencies:**
- Line 25 has a typo: "Inscrytpion" → "Inscryption" YEP FIX
- Line 25 formatting: underscore/italic combo `-_Inspired...` looks odd REMOVE UNDERLINE
- Version in "Repository Structure" says v9.97 but game is now v12.73+ REMOVE VERSION FROM THIS PAGE
- "For Beta Testers" section - is the game still in beta? Should this be "How to Play"? THERE SHOULD BE A FOR BETA TESTERS SECTION THAT EMPHASIZES THE ELEMENTS I AM CURRENTLY WANTING FEEDBACK ON. ADD A HOW TO PLAY 

**Voice Questions:**
- Death quotes mix Michigan J. Frog lyrics with original content - is that intentional? (Copyright-adjacent?)  DEFINITELY INTENTIONAL, I MAKE FROGGER REFERENCES AND A GOOD PLACE REFERENCE AND EVERY FROG REFERENCE I CAN THINK OF SO I THINK ITS SAFE TO HAVE A FEW MICHIGAN J FROGS (i am sort of trying to imply that Death is MJF but that's strictly implied, not explicit)
- "please don't steal it please!" - charming or unprofessional? (I vote charming) You can leave it, I like it.
- Is "weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable" the tagline? It's great but buried mid-paragraph EITHER THIS OR "Live. Die. Ribbit." WHICH IS A PLAY ON THE TOM CRUISE MOVIE. Weirdly Empowering Delightfully Breakable should be included in the Steam page though.

**Feature List Polish:**
- Current: "9 encounters, each with a hidden unlockable second stage" REPLACE '9' WITH 'many mysterious"
- Are there really 9 encounters? Double-check count YES
- "18 strategic combat floors" - there are 10 combat floors (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19) REPLACE WITH TACTICAL COMBAT EMPHASIS DON'T NAME FLOOR COUNT
- Consider: odd floors are combat, even are neutral - might be clearer NAH USE ABOVE SUGGESTIONS
- I MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING ABOUT BEING AN INDEPENDENT DEVELOPER AND THIS BEING MY FIRST GAME, HELPFUL OR NO?

**Potential Taglines to Test:**
- "Save Tapo. Roll dice. Get frogged." REMOVE
- "A roguelike that ribbits different" REMOVE
- "Tactically questionable. Emotionally devastating. Extremely froggy." I KIND OF LIKE THIS, ITS NOT THE TAGLINE BUT KEEP IT SOMEWHERE FOR ME TO SEE LATER.
- "Die. Upgrade. Ribbit. Repeat."

**Missing from README?**
- PWA/installable mention (it's a full app!) REMOVE THEN, REPLACE WITH AVAILABLE VERSIONS/COMPATIBLE DEVICES/PLATFORMS
- Controller/Steam Deck support deserves more than a one-liner KEEP THIS NOTE FOR ME ONCE NEW VERSION IS BUILT
- No screenshots or GIFs - would help a lot IN PROGRESS
- No mention of the procedural music/sound system (it's cool!) SO SOMETHING LIKE "Funky froggy procedurally-generated beats?"

**Easter Eggs & Secrets - Document or Keep Hidden?** KEEP THESE HIDDEN, REMOVE, DONT NEED THEM LISTED AT ALL
- Ghost Boys encounter
- Ancient Statuette
- Tapo as 5th hero (mentioned but vague)
- FU mode portal
- Second-stage neutral encounters

### Draft Rewrites - tweaked below!

**Current About (first line):**
> FROGGLE is a weirdly empowering, delightfully breakable, indie (f)roguelike/(f)roguelite dungeon crawler. Upgrade abilities, unlock powerful sigils, and figure out cool ways to combo them!


NOTE TO CLAUDE, I WILL WANT YOU TO REASSEMBLE ALL OF THIS INTO A NEW DRAFT USING MY FEEDBACK, THEN PUSH THAT UPDATE FOR ME TO REVIEW NEXT. THIS IS A VERY PIECEMEAL REVIEW AND I WANT TO REVIEW MORE HOLISTICALLY.
